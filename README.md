# Text Analysis Project Using Regular Expressions in Python

## Introduction

In today's digital age, text analysis and processing have become an essential part of various applications such as search engines, text classification, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. This project aims to explore and utilize the `re` library in Python for text cleaning and processing.

## Description

In this project, we use Python's `re` library to clean text data by removing unwanted elements such as:
- Removing URLs
- Masking email addresses
- Removing numbers
- Cleaning up unnecessary symbols

These techniques are applied to different types of text, including those related to sports clubs like Al Ahly Club, which contain historical and sports-related details.
